🔍 Iris Flower Classification — Machine Learning Project
This project uses machine learning algorithms to classify iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on features like sepal and petal length and width.

It includes:

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

⚙️ Model training using Logistic Regression, SVM, and KNN

✅ Model evaluation with accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix

📉 Visualizations of decision boundaries, 3D scatter plots, and feature importance

Built in Google Colab with pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
